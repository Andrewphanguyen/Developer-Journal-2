# Planner vs Journal Decision

- During 050124-brainstorm meeting group debated the focus of our app.
- The discussion was between building a planner/to-do list vs a journal

### Planner Argument
A planner/to-do list focuses on tasks; i.e. complex tasks with deadlines, details, notes, etc.
Following this, the calendar would be the homepage and most functionality would be centered around the calendar
and the action of adding/deleting/updating tasks and events. Journaling would be a secondary feature that users
can use at the end of each day.

### Journal Argument
A journal focuses more on the refleciton and summarization of a developer's workday. It would encourage users
to give a brief reflection on their day, what they accomplished, how they felt, etc. It would not emphasize
tasks but would likely still have tasks and events as objects that the user can interact with.

**Decision**: Make Journaling the focus of our app
