- 5 different smiley faces placed in a row. Can be either satisfied/unsatisfied, angry/sad/happy, etc. they will be colored red/yellow/green     accordingly
- Underneath put an indicator for the user’s selection, “you selected…”
- Have the button trigger a message depending on their selection. Celebratory for happy, or ‘hope you feel better’ for sad
- Start with the basic buttons and features for now using HTML/CSS/JS, make it more advanced or add animations if we have time later
