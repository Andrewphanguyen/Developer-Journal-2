## Brainstorming
Used Miro for brainstorming different features, designs, wants, and examples for the project:
### Initial Features:
- Daily task list
- Tag tasks with completion date
- User sign-in
- Search features to find previus tasks
- Password required / account created
- Hover over task title to open description
- Graph of emotional state ratings
### User Wants:
- Person A: Wants something simple that they can get done in a few minutes everyday so they have time to work on their tasks
- Person B: Wants a log of what they've done everyday for the past unit of time so they can remember everything they have done if their boss ever asks them
- Person C: Wants to document their work and mental health so they can keep track of their feelings
- Person D: I'm extremely unorganized on my work, so I really need a good widget to keep track of what I have done every day.
- Person E: I'm forgetful so I need something to remember the things that I have to do
- Person F: I use a 2008 MacBook so I need a browser application that is lightweight so it will run smoothly
- Person G: I sometimes have a lot of different thoughts about my daily tasks so I like having a journal space where I can jot down any thoughts that I have
## Design
Each group member individually spend 15 minutes to draw out an design and then presented their design with the group. Then we combined all our ideas to form a final-ish design:
