## Color
Gray/egg white, with light/dark blue accents. Exact color scheme on Miro board.

## Big Decisions
Website will be more of a journal than task list. Journal on main page, daily journaling. Tasks on a side bar. View of week on other side, with current day on the bottom. Journal editor is always open for editing.

## Flow Chart
Options from home page: make, edit, delete tasks; view calendar/view past journals; journal for the day.

## Organization
Store list of features in 3 separate Google docs: Tasks, Journaling, Calendar.

## Task List
No deadlines associated with task list, just used to mark completed tasks in the past. Calendar cannot be used for future planning. Just a scratch pad to see what you have to do. A feature to add colors, and ability to drag and drop. When you mark a task as done, it gets added to the current day automatically. Looking for a new terminology for the task list, since task is such a loaded term. Concerns with adding more features to tasks, as it will make it turn into more of a planner than a journal. Change name from tasks to reminders. Add task button at the top. Debate over if reminders get addded to top or bottom, voted to hop down to bottom to add it. Edit opens when you press on reminder, can only edit color and title. 60 character limit on titles, and wrap. More details can be added in journal. OPTIONAL: Add ability to say worked on a taks for a day but not completed. Each day there is a box with completed tasks. As you add, they get moved into this box. When viewing past days you can see this list.

## Calender
Displays tasks completed that day, as well as productivity and mental health. Future days are grayed out. You can press into a day to pull up journal with mental health and tasks completed. Different colors for mental health/productivity levels.

## Information Retention
Will there be separate user accounts on a single computer or is it just stored locally. Does it save information between open and closing?

## Pitch Preperation
Working on google doc, then will transfer to markdown. Planning on splitting into groups for tasklist, journal, calendar. Work on getting front end up first, then once the shell of the website looks good, we implement back end. Dividing into 3 groups: home page design, calendar design, JS research into supporting saving data. Intitial phase will be to get website looking good with no functionality, next step is implementing functionality, final will be saving data locally.

Need to include problem, user stories, appetite/timeline, rabbit holes/potential risks, and no-goes/things to avoid.
