## Agenda
1. Review
2. Stand Up
3. Sprints

### Review
Andrew will be in charge of the pipeline, we need to finish our pipeline and make sure we know when the pipeline should run. Need to update the pipeline diagram, and make sure that the pipeline should also run not just on main, but also on some of the important branches such as calendar-front. 
Make sure to check documentations before pushing to main, checking the if things like JsDocs and Codacy is working properly.

### Stand up
Homepage:
Primarily task list stuff, when performance takes too long, and formatting such as name of the tasks. Also want to implement some small things such as moving the completed task, changed sidebar, headers, add tasks, delete tasks, and things like hovering. 

Calendar:
Making the format inside the boxes of every day, including things like the emojis and the task name lists. Also made changes to things like shrinking the window size and what would happen when resizing happens. Instead of the third task, we can have something else such as +3 more task.

Javascript:
Not much done in last week, just need the structure done so we can start working on the local storage stuff to read the input and extract the output.

### Sprints
Record a quick demo for the parts of project that we have, also showcase the pipeline stuff. We plan on doing the retrospective on friday.

### Update Pitch
- Fix specifics of non functional features
- Focus on responsiveness and accessibility, not as worried about performance because back end is relatively simple
- Storage is just local storage

### Assignments
#### Javascript Team
- Start working on the localstorage

#### Homepage Team
- Implement some of the small things such as the functions for marking the tasks completed, add/deleting tasks.

#### Calendar Team
- Implemebnt the boxes within the cladendar and finalize the format, let the Homepage Team know how the format is so they can adjust the small calendar on the Homepage.
