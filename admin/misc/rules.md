# Team Contract
## Means of Communication
- Slack will primarily be used. Please have notifications on and acknowledge/respond to messages that involve you.
- Email will be used if necessary

## Meeting Scheduling
- Fridays 12:30 to ~2:00 pm, in-person. This meeting is intended to be mandatory, but it is okay if members miss it.
- We need a second day/time that everyone is available in case we need more meetings, however, it doesn’t look like there is another time that works for everyone according to this WhenToMeet. Therefore, if necessary, we will try to find time to schedule late-night or Zoom meetings 
- Please give some notice if you plan to miss any meetings and follow-up with team so that you're caught up..

## General Responsibilities
- Be available as much as possible, and let other team members know if you are unavailable.
- Communicate with other team members if a problem arises or if you think that something will interfere with completing your assigned work by the deadline
- Maintain a productive environment that supports other team members
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help

## Conflict Resolution
- Conflict should generally be handled in private with all individuals involved.
- If you want a mediator, reach out to a team lead.

## Deadlines
- Smaller parts and milestones of the project will be given deadlines
- Try to have most, if not all, of your part done the day before the deadline in case any changes or updates need to be made. This also applies to course assignments.

## Documentation
- Leave descriptive documentation to make collaboration easier. 
- Always make sure comments are there and understandable before pushing to the main branch.
- Follow the previously created meeting notes and other files for style guidance.

## Styling
- 4-space tabs
- Minimize unnecessary whitespace
- Leave multi-line comments when necessary.

## Git
- All commits should first be pushed to a separate branch from the main, then we can merge if ready
